README

From Gravatar Help:
	"A gravatar is a dynamic image resource that is requested from our server. The request
	URL is presented here, broken into its segments."
	
Source:
	http://site.gravatar.com/site/implement

First of all, this class was not written by me. We owe it to Lucas Araújo
<araujo.lucas@gmail.com> who wrote the original Gravatar class in PHP. All
I did was copy it to GitHub and add/modify some functionality:

	- now supports checking to see if a Gravatar image actually exists
	- returns the Gravatar URL by default, instead of an image tag
	- visibility of the $this->email property is now public
	
The class still supports the $default image thing if you'd like to use it,
but it'd probably be better to check if a Gravatar exists beforehand and
then act accordingly in your implementation.

Lucas's original implementation may be found at:
	http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/4227.html
	
USAGE

The following code will check to see if a Gravatar exists, and if so, show
it with no parameters.

<code>

	$email = "youremail@yourhost.com";
	$gravatar = new Gravatar($email);	// create new Gravatar with email
	$gravatar->size = 128;
	$gravatar->rating = "G";
	
	if ($gravatar->gravatarExists()) {
		echo '<img src="' . $gravatar . '" alt="" />';	
	} else {
		echo 'No Gravatar exists for this email address';
	}
	
</code>

A sample PHP program is included that shows a similar demonstration and can
be run on your own server without modification.

OTHER FUNCTIONS

$Grav = new Gravatar( [$email, [$default]] );	// make a Gravatar object
bool $Grav->setEmail($email);
bool $Grav->setDefault($default);
bool $Grav->setRating($rating);					// maximum rating (G,PG,R,X)
bool $Grav->setSize($size);						// size to get URL of
bool $Grav->setExtra($extra);					// parameters to add to img tag

bool $Grav->gravatarExists();					// check if Gravatar exists
string $Grav->imageTag()						// get a complete <img> tag
string $Grav->gravatarLink()					// get the Gravatar.com URL

echo $Grav										// same as $Grav->gravatarLink()
